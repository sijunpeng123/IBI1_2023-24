According to the feedback of the formative portfolio, I have made changes to my previous codes.

For week 3, I edited the Things I like and the reflections documents and made commitments. 
For week 4, I corrected the calculation of e, and completed the table. 
For week 6, I added the missing codes and made changes according to the instructions.
